## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - Tailwindcss

### What I learned

- Building a web from scratch using React JS and styling seperated components with all CSS using utilities classes first approach;
- Build up databases under json structure for effective content distribution of similar components
- Using custom CSS properties to create custom components as well as fluid typography for responisve design

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
export const feeds = [
  {
    image: images["icon-blacklist"],
    title: "Quick Search",
    content:
      "  Easily search your snippets by content, category, web address, application, and more.",
  },
  {
    image: images["icon-text"],
    title: "iCloud Sync",
    content: "Instantly saves and syncs snippets across all your devices.",
  },
  {
    image: images["icon-preview"],
    title: "Complete History",
    content:
      "Retrieve any snippets from the first moment you started using the app.",
  },
];
```

### Continued development

- I am going to keep trying to have a good grasp of using Tailwinds class in advanced projects.
- Fully comprehend the React's hooks by building external data fetching flows and maintain states throught out the app in the future projects.
